Hence, the project developer owns generation as well as distribution assets and is responsible for providing (or attracting) capital, engaging customers, taking care of operation and maintenance, and fulfilling all regulatory duties. The community's role is rather small, however, certain roles can be negotiated with the project developer, such as installation and maintenance tasks.",isolated_operator_led.png,isolated_operator_led_resp.png

The co-op together with the undergrid community is responsible for project planning, development, and capital raising. The co-op owns the mini-grid generation and distribution assets and is responsible for customer relations and billing. For certain tasks, the co-op engages a mini-grid operator on behalf of the community and uses the operator's experience by subcontracting the installation of generation, storage, and distribution as well as respective responsibilities related to operation and maintenance. The cooperative-led model strongly enhances local awareness and engagement. While attracting commercial financing is often difficult under a co-op approach, a co-op may have access to concessional financing options and can achieve lower tariffs for customers in the community. Also, entities such as Nigeria's Rural Electrification Agency (REA) or other government agencies can provide support to communities in the early phases of project development.

Under this approach a private mini-grid operator leads development of the mini-grid and consults the distribution company and community as needed. The Mini-grid operator is responsible for providing (or attracting) capital, engaging customers, and taking over operation and maintenance duties of generation assets. The operator company owns the mini-grid generation assets, while the present distribution company owns the distribution assets and collects a usage fee. The community's role is rather small and can be negotiated with the operator company. ",interconnected_operator_led.png,interconnected_operator_led_resp.png

The co-op engages the DisCo and mini-grid operator on behalf of the community and uses the experience of an operator, i.e. subcontracting generation, storage, distribution, and O&M functions. Depending on local technical and financial capacities as well as governance skills, the cooperative-led model overcomes best the lack of local awareness and engagement.
