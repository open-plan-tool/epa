Hence, the mini-grid company owns generation as well as distribution assets and is responsible for providing (and/or attracting) capital, engaging customers, taking care of operation and maintenance, and fulfilling all regulatory duties. The community's role is rather small, however, certain responsibilities can be negotiated with the mini-grid company, such as installation and maintenance tasks.

For certain tasks, the co-op might subcontract a mini-grid company for tasks, such as the installation of generation, storage, and distribution parts.
